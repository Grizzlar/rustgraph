# RustGraph
A simple implementation of the HashGraph consensus algorithm in Rust. Based on [https://www.swirlds.com/downloads/SWIRLDS-TR-2016-01.pdf](https://www.swirlds.com/downloads/SWIRLDS-TR-2016-01.pdf)

This is my first project in rust so it might not be optimized and might be full of bugs. My aim is to learn more about the HashGraph consensus algorithm by attempting to implement it and gain more experience in Rust by using it in a personal project.
